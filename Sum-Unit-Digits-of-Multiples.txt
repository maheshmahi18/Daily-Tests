Sum-Unit Digits of Multiples


The program must accept two integers M and N as the input. The program must print the sum of unit digits of all the multiples of N from 1 to M as the output.


Boundary Condition(s):

1 <= M <= 10^18
1 <= N <= M


Input Format:

The first line contains the values of M and N separated by a space.


Output Format:

The first line contains the value of the sum based on the given condition.


Example Input/Output 1:


Input:

25 5


Output:

15


Explanation:

The multiples of 5 from 1 to 25 are 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25. The unit digits of these multiples are 5, 0, 5, 0 and 5. So their sum is 15.

Hence the output is 15


Example Input/Output 2:


Input

100 13


Output:

34



Sollution: Done in Python


a,b=map(int,input().split())
c=a//b
m=1
n=b
s=0
while(c>0):
    e=str(m*n)
    s+=int(e[-1])
    m+=1
    c-=1
print(s)
