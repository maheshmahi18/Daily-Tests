Form Integers - Unit Digit & Tenth Digit


The program must accept N integers as the input. For every two consecutive integers X and Y among the N integers, the program must form an integer by concatenating the unit digit of X and the tenth digit of Y. Then the program must print all the obtained integers in the order of occurrence as the output.


Boundary Condition(s):

2 <= N <= 100

10 <= Each integer value <= 10^5


Input Format:

The first line contains the value of N.

The second line contains the N integers separated by space(s)


Output Format:

The first line contains the integers separated by a space based on the given conditions


Example Input/Output 1:


Input

5

19 12 56 20 50


Output:

91 25 62 5


Explanation:

The unit digit of 19 is 9 and the tenth digit of 12 is 1. so 91 is printed.

The unit digit of 12 is 2 and the tenth digit of 56 is 5. so 25 is printed.

The unit digit of 56 is 6 and the tenth digit of 20 is 2. so 62 is printed.

The unit digit of 20 is 0 and the tenth digit of 50 is 5. so 5 is printed.



Example Input/Output 2:


Input

6

520 50 18 10 99 247


Output:

5 1 81 9 94


Sollution: Done in Python


n=int(input())
a=list(map(str,input().split()))
for i in range(n-1):
    print(int(a[i][-1]+a[i+1][-2]),end=" ")
