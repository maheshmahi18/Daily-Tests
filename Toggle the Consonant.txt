Toggle the Consonant

The program accepts a string S containing only lower case alphabets as the input. For each vowel in S, the program must toggle the case of next consonant in S. Finally, the program must print the modified string S as the output.


Boundary Condition(s):

2 <= Length of S <= 10000

Input Format:

The first line contains S.

Output Format:

The first line contains the modified string S.


Example Input/Output 1:

Input:

about

Output:

aBout

Explanation:
The ISt vowel in the string "a out" is Iai and the next consonant of tat is So the case of ibi is toggled.
Now the string becomes "aBout".
The 2nd vowel in the string "aBou " is 'o' and the next consonant of 'o' is 't'. So the case of 't' is toggled.
Now the string becomes "aBouT".
The 3rd vowel in the string "aBou " is 'u' and the next consonant of â€¢u' is So the case of IT' is toggled.
Now the string becomes "aBout".
Hence the output is aBout


Example Input/Output 2:

Input:

adoc

Output:

aDoC


Example Input/Output 3:

Input:

aeibco

Output:

aeiBco



Sollution: Done in Python


s=input().strip()
s=[i for i in s]
for i in range(len(s)):
    if s[i].lower() in "aeiou":
        for j in range(i+1,len(s)):
            if s[j].lower() not in "aeiou":
                s[j] = s[j].swapcase()
                break
print("".join(s))
