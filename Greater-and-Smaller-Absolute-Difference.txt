Greater and Smaller-Absolute Difference


The program must accept N integers and an integer K as the input. The program must print the absolute difference between the number of integers greater than or equal to K and the number of integers less than K as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):

1 < = N, K<= 10^3
1 <= Each integer value <= 10^3


Input Format:

The first line contains N.
The second line contains N integers separated by a space.
The third line contains K.

Output Format:

The first line contains the absolute difference.

Example Input/Output 1:

Input:

5
20 30 50 44 10
35

Output:

1


Explanation:

There are two integers (44 and 50) which are greater than or equal to 35.
There are three integers (20 30 and 10) which are less than 35.
Here the absolute difference is 12 - 31 = 1

Hence the output is 1

Example Input/Output 2:

Input:

10
3 7 9 4 1 13 6 2 5 8
3

Output:

6


Sollution: Done in Python


n=int(input())
a=list(map(int,input().split()))
b=int(input())
c=0;d=0
for i in a:
    if i>=b:
         c+=1
    else:
	 d+=1
e=[c,d]
print(max(e)-min(e))
