Print Rows Alternatively


The program must accept two integer matrices of size RxC as the input. The program must print the first row in the first matrix, the second row in the second matrix, the third row in the first matrix, the fourth row in the second matix and so on.


Boundary Condition(s):

2 <= R, C <= 100


Input Format:

The first line contains two integers R and C separated by a space.

The next 2*R lines contain C integers separated by space(s).


Output Format:

The first R lines contain C integers separated by a space.


Example Input/Output 1:

Input:

4 5
1 0 5 12 5
4 8 2 6 2 
7 6 9 5 6
10 2 3 4 7
4 10 5 5 0
2 9 7 1 2
12 5 6 0 4
7 8 12 4 8

Output: 

1 0 5 12 5
2 9 7 1 2
7 6 9 5 6
7 8 12 4 8


Explanation:

The 1st row elements in the first matrix are printed as.

The 2nd row elements in the second matrix are printed as.

The 3rd row elements in the first matrix are printed as.

The 4th row elements in the second matrix are printed as

Example Input/Output 2:

Input:

3 2
8 12
22 45
8 12
10 20
40 50
70 80

Output: 

8 12
40 50
8 12



Sollution: Done in Python


//Your code here
a,b=map(int,input().split())
m=[];n=[]
for i in range(a):
    m.append(list(map(int,input().split())))
for i in range(a):
    n.append(list(map(int,input().split())))
for i in range(a):
    if(i%2==0):
        for j in range(b):
            print(m[i][j],end=" ")
    else:
        for j in range(b):
            print(n[i][j],end=" ")
    print()
