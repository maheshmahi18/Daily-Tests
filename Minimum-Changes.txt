Minimum Changes

The program must accept two integers Nl and N2 as the input. The program must find the minimum number of changes required to make the integers equal. A change represents dividing an integer by 2 (consider floor value when dividing an odd
integer) and print the minimum number of changes as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):

1 <= N1,  N2 <= I0^5

Input Format:

The first line contains Nl and N2 separated by a space.

Output Format:

The first line contains the minimum number of changes required to make the integers equal.


Example Input/Output 1:

Input:

16 5

Output:

4

Explanation:

3 Changes in 16: 16/2 8/2 4/2 2
1 Change in 5: 5/2 -Y 2

Example Input/Output 2:

Input:

13 17

Output:

7


Sollution: Done in Python


a,b=map(int,input().split())
c=0
while(a!=b):
    if(a>b):
        a//=2
    else:
        b//=2
    c+=1
print(c)
