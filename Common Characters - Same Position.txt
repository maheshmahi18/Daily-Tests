Common Characters - Same Position


The program must accept N string values are of equal length as the input. The program must print the common characters at the same position in all the N string values as the output.

Note:
- At least one common character at the same position is always present in the N string values.

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= N <= 100
1 <= Length of S <= 1000

Input Format:

The first line contains N.
The next N lines each contain a string value.

Output Format:

The first line contains the common characters.


Example Input/Output 1:

Input:

3
next
best
test

Output:

et


Explanation:

Here e and t are the common characters present at the same position in the three string values.

Hence the output is et


Example Input/Output 2:

Input:

4
holding
waiting
walking
selling

Output:
ing


Sollution: Done in Python


n=int(input())
a=[]
for i in range(n):
  a.append(input().strip())

b=0;c=0
for i in range(len(a[0])):
  e=a[b][c]
  d=0
  for j in range(n):
    if(a[j][i]==e):
      d+=1
  if(d==n):
    print(e,end="")
  c+=1
