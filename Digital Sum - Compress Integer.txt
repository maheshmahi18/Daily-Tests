Digital Sum - Compress Integer


The program must accept an integer N as the input. The program must compress the integer N by concatenating the digital sum of every two consecutive digits. Then the program must print the modified value of N as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):

10 <= N <= 10^9

Input Format:
The first line contains the value of N.

Output Format:
The first line contains the modified value of N.


Example Input/Output 1:

Input:

208914

Output:

28815

Explanation:

The digital sum of 2 and 0 is 2
The digital sum of 0 and 8 is 8
The digital sum of 8 and 9 is 8
The digital sum of 9 and 1 is 1
The digital sum ofl and 4 is 5

Hence the output is 28815


Example Input/Output 2:

Input:

1234

Output:

357



Sollution: Done in Python


s=input().strip()
a=0
for i in range(len(s)-1):
    b=int(s[i])+int(s[i+1])
    if(len(str(b))==1):
        print(b,end="")
    else:
        c=0
        for j in str(b):
            c+=int(j)
        if(len(str(c))==1):
            print(c,end="")
