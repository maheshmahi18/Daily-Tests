Unit Digit - Replace by O

The program must accept an integer N as the input. The program must replace all the occurrences of the unit digit of N by O in 
the integer N. Finally, the program must print the modified value of N as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):

1 <= N <= 10^8
s
Input Format:

The first line contains the value of N.

Output Format:

The first line contains the modified value of N.


Example Input/Output 1:

Input:

1021

Ouput:

20

Explanation:
The unit digit of 1021 is 1.
So after replacing all the occurrence of I by O, the integer becomes 0020.

Hence the output is 20


Example Input/Output 2:

Input:

202202

Ouput:

0



Sollution: Done in Python
