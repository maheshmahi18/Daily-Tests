First and Last Rows or Columns


The program must accept an integer matrix of size NxN as the input. If N is odd then the program must print the integers in the first and last rows of the matrix as the output. Else the program must print the integers in the first and last columns of the matrix as the output.


Boundary Condition(s):

2 <= N <= 100


Input Format:

The first line contains the integer N.

The next N lines contain N integers separated by space(s).


Output Format:

The first line contains either first row or first column integers in the matrix.

The second line contains either last row or last column integers in the matrix.


Example Input/Output 1:

Input

4
10 20 40 50
90 30 80 70
25 45 35 65
60 55 15 85

Output:

10 90 25 60
50 70 65 85


Explanation:

N = 4, Here 4 is even

So the first column elements 10, 90, 25 and 60 are printed. 
Then the last column elements are 50, 70, 65 and 85 are printed.


Example Input/Output 2:

Input

3
9 8 2
6 2 3
4 7 5

Output:

9 8 2
4 7 5


Sollution: Done in Python


n=int(input())
a=[]
for i in range(n):
    a.append(list(map(int,input().split())))
if(n%2!=0):
    print(*a[0])
    print(*a[n-1])
else:
    for i in range(n):
        print(a[i][0],end=" ")
    print()
    for i in range(n):
        print(a[i][n-1],end=" ")
