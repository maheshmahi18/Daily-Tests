The program must accept N string values as the input. The program must print the string 5 with the maximum number of consonants. If more than one string have the maximum number of consonants then print the first occurring string. 

Note: At least one string will contain one or more consonants.


Boundary Condition(s):

1 <= N, Length of 5 <= 10^3


Input Format:

The first line contains N.

The next N lines contain the string values.


Output Format:

The first line contains the string value which has maximum number of consonants.


Example Input/Output 1:

Sollution: Done in Python


n=int(input())
a=[];b=[]
d="aeiouAEIOU"
for i in range(n):
    c=input().strip()
    a.append(c)
    m=0
    for j in c:
        if j not in d:
            m+=1
    b.append(m)
print(a[b.index(max(b))])
